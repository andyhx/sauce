@BOOK{Brad08,
  title = {{Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library}},
  publisher = {O'Reilly},
  year = {2008},
  author = {Bradski, Gary and Kaehler, Adrian},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  abstract = {{Learning OpenCV puts you right in the middle of the rapidly expanding
	field of computer vision. Written by the creators of OpenCV, the
	widely used free open- source library, this book introduces you to
	computer vision and demonstrates how you can quickly build applications
	that enable computers to "see" and make decisions based on the data.
	Computer vision is everywhere -- in security systems, manufacturing
	inspection systems, medical image analysis, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,
	and more. It helps robot cars drive by themselves, stitches Google
	maps and Google Earth together, checks the pixels on your laptop's
	LCD screen, and makes sure the stitches in your shirt are OK. OpenCV
	provides an easy-to-use computer vision infrastructure along with
	a comprehensive library containing more than 500 functions that can
	run vision code in real time. With Learning OpenCV, any developer
	or hobbyist can get up and running with the framework quickly, whether
	it's to build simple or sophisticated vision applications. The book
	includes: A thorough introduction to OpenCV Getting input from cameras
	Transforming images Shape matching Pattern recognition, including
	face detection Segmenting images Tracking and motion in 2 and 3 dimensions
	Machine learning algorithms Hands-on exercises at the end of each
	chapter help you absorb the concepts, and an appendix explains how
	to set up an OpenCV project in Visual Studio. OpenCV is written in
	performance optimized C/C++ code, runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac
	OS X, and is free for commercial and research use under a BSD license.
	Getting machines to see is a challenging but entertaining goal. If
	you're intrigued by the possibilities, Learning OpenCV gets you started
	onbuilding computer vision applications of your own.}},
